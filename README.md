In this project a Time-series forecasting was done to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.
Specifically, time series baseline models and supervised models were built which was further optimized to accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.
